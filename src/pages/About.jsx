        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Alex! At the core of my professional and personal ethos lies a
            deep commitment to the principles of LDRSHIP - Loyalty, Duty, Respect,
            Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. These
            values, instilled in me during my time in the Army, continue to guide
            my approach to life and work. I am also a strong proponent of the
            servant leader model, believing that true leadership comes from
            serving and empowering others. Military service, coupled with a
            frontline role in my community hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic,
            has profoundly shaped my perspective. These challenging, yet enriching
            experiences, have reinforced my belief in teamwork, resilience, and
            the relentless pursuit of meaningful goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I look to the future, I aim to be an integral part of a team, lead
            with purpose, and contribute to building something that positively
            impacts our collective digital future. My journey has been one of continuous learning, adaptation, and a
            relentless pursuit of excellence, always with an eye towards serving
            others and bettering our world.
        </p>

            I was first introduced to programming through my occupational
            specialty in the Army. Executing complex programming protocols for
            radar hard drives, configuring and managing local area networks, and
            optimizing functionality and security in mission-critical situations
            completely solidified my love for functional utility. I am driven to
            integrate this practical reliability with streamlined efficiency to
            continuously bridge utility and elegance.
